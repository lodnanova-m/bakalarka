# Svelte

This project is built with Svelte, a revolutionary tool for building fast web applications with a unique compile-time approach to rendering. Unlike traditional frameworks that use a virtual DOM, Svelte's strength is its ability to update the DOM directly, which can have implications for SEO and how web crawlers index the site.

# Key Features
* Compile-time Rendering: Transforms the application into optimized JavaScript at build time, ensuring quick, efficient updates directly to the DOM.
* No virtual DOM: eliminates th eneed for a virtual DOM, reduciing complexity and improving performance.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```
2. Start the development server:
```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

# Svelte and Web Crawlers: Enhancing SEO
While Svelte applications are client-side rendered by default, there are strategies to ensure your content is crawlable and SEO-friendly:

* Pre-rendering: Svelte apps can be pre-rendered into static files. This process generates HTML files for each route, making your content immediately visible to web crawlers without the need for JavaScript execution.
* Dynamic Rendering: For dynamic content, consider using a server or service to render pages on-demand for web crawlers. This approach provides the SEO benefits of server-side rendering without needing to fully convert your application.
* SEO Best Practices: Utilize semantic HTML and ensure your site is accessible. Use <meta> tags effectively in your Svelte components to define descriptions, keywords, and social media previews.
