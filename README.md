# Bachelor's Thesis
### Author: Michaela Lodňanová 525221
This repository contains the prototypes developed as part of my bachelor's thesis. The primary focus of this thesis is to evaluate the performance, crawlability, and SEO of various web application frameworks and libraries.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **angular-app**
- **csr-react**
- **jet-vdom-web-app**
- **jet-web-app**
- **next_js_app**
- **preact-app**
- **svelte-app**
- **backend**

Each directory contains a separate prototype application built using a specific framework or library. These prototypes are used for testing and comparing different aspects of web development technologies. The backend directory contains a server implemented with Node.js and Express to support these applications.

## Projects

### angular-app
An Angular application created to test the performance, crawlability, and SEO capabilities of the Angular framework.

### csr-react
A Client-Side Rendered React application designed to analyze how CSR affects performance, crawlability, and SEO.

### jet-vdom-web-app
An Oracle JET application utilizing Virtual DOM architecture to evaluate its performance and SEO characteristics.

### jet-web-app
A traditional Oracle JET application to compare against the Virtual DOM version for performance and SEO.

### next_js_app
A Next.js application focusing on Server-Side Rendering (SSR) to see its impact on performance, crawlability, and SEO.

### preact-app
A Preact application built to test a lightweight alternative to React and its implications on performance and SEO.

### svelte-app
A Svelte application developed to understand how its unique compilation approach influences performance, crawlability, and SEO.

### backend
A Node.js and Express server to support the frontend applications. This server provides API endpoints and serves static files. Detailed setup instructions are provided in the backend directory.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this thesis are:
- To measure the performance of each framework/library.
- To analyze how well each application can be crawled by search engines.
- To evaluate the SEO potential of each prototype.

Each prototype is built with these objectives in mind, providing a comprehensive comparison across different web development technologies.

## Getting Started

To explore any of the prototypes, navigate to the respective directory and follow the setup instructions provided in the README file within each directory.

## Conclusion

This repository serves as a foundation for understanding the strengths and weaknesses of various web frameworks and libraries in the context of performance, crawlability, and SEO. The insights gained from this research can guide developers in choosing the right technology for their specific needs.
